# ML|Credit Card Fraud Detection
The challenge is to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that the customers of credit card companies are not charged for items that they did not purchase.

# Main challenges involved in credit card fraud detection are:
1. Enormous Data is processed every day and the model build must be fast enough to respond to the scam in time.
2. Imbalanced Data i.e most of the transactions (99.8%) are not fraudulent which makes it really hard for detecting the fraudulent ones
3. Data availability as the data is mostly private.
4. Misclassified Data can be another major issue, as not every fraudulent transaction is caught and reported.
5. Adaptive techniques used against the model by the scammers.

# How to tackle the challenges
1. The model used must be simple and fast enough to detect the anomaly and classify it as a fraudulent transaction as quickly as possible.
2. For protecting the privacy of the user the dimensionality of the data can be reduced.
3. A more trustworthy source must be taken which double-check the data, at least for training the model.

# Steps to follow 
1. Importing all the required libraries
2. Loading the data
3. understanding and describing the data
4. Finding out the imbalance in data
5. Print the amount details for Fraudulent Transaction
6. Print the amount details for Normal Transaction
7. Plotting the corelation matrix
8. Separating the X and the Y values
9. Training and testing the data
10. Building random forest model uing scikit learn
11. Building all kind of evalution methods
12. Visulization the matrix
